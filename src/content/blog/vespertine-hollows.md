Vespertine hollows drift through the waning gargoyles, where chimeric whispers collect beneath forgotten spires. The stonework remembers what the moths have taken.

## The Weight of Empty Rooms

There's a particular quality to spaces that have been left behind. Not abandoned in haste, but slowly emptied — one presence at a time — until only the architecture remains. These rooms hold their breath.

I've been thinking about liminal spaces lately. The in-between moments. Hallways at 3 AM. The last train platform. Hotel lobbies where no one stays for long.

## What the Walls Know

Every surface accumulates. Dust, certainly, but also something less tangible. The echo of conversations. The imprint of routines. Walk into an old building and you can feel it — the sediment of lived experience.

The gargoyles watch from their perches, patient as geology. They've seen centuries of foot traffic below, patterns repeating and dissolving like tides.

## Closing Thoughts

Perhaps this is why I'm drawn to the cosmic and the oceanic in equal measure. Both offer that same sense of vast indifference, of time scales that render human concerns appropriately small. Not nihilism — more like perspective.

The hollows wait. The spires endure. And somewhere in the space between, we make what meaning we can.
