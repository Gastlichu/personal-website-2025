The stonework remembers what the moths have taken. Even silence has texture at this depth.

## On Building for Time

There's hubris in architecture. The audacity to say: this will stand. This will outlast me, my children, perhaps my civilization. And yet we keep building.

Cathedrals took generations to complete. The workers who laid the foundation never saw the spires rise. They built on faith — not necessarily religious faith, but faith in continuity. Faith that someone would carry on.

## Digital Ruins

What are our digital spaces if not architecture? We build sites, platforms, experiences. Most will be forgotten within years. The average website lifespan is... sobering.

But some persist. Some become load-bearing walls in the infrastructure of how we communicate, create, exist online. These weren't always planned as permanent. They just became essential, one user at a time.

## What Moths Take

Moths don't eat stone. They eat fabric, paper, organic matter. The soft things. The records, the tapestries, the books. History's physical documentation.

What survives? The structure. The shape of rooms. The proportions that pleased an architect dead five hundred years.

And so we find ourselves interpreting buildings without context. The stonework remembers the shape of gatherings but not the words spoken. The height of ceilings but not the songs that filled them.

## Building Anyway

This isn't an argument against creation. Quite the opposite.

Build knowing it may not last. Build because the act of building matters independent of permanence. Build to solve present problems, knowing future ones will differ.

The cathedrals are beautiful precisely because their builders couldn't guarantee anything. They built anyway. Stone by stone. Generation by generation.

We do the same, pixel by pixel. Commit by commit.
