Created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 52, *Bioluminescent* explores the theme of "Harvest" through the lens of deep-sea ecology. You play as a glowing organism that must carefully manage your light to attract prey while avoiding predators drawn to the same glow.

A meditation on the delicate balance of survival in the abyss.
