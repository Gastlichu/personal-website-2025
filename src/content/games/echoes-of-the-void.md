*Echoes of the Void* began as an experiment in creating spaces that feel simultaneously vast and intimate. The player drifts through abandoned structures floating in an endless dark, each room a fragment of a story told in architecture and light.

The game uses no text or dialogue — meaning is conveyed entirely through environmental storytelling and the subtle language of space itself.
